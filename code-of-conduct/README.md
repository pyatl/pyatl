# Code of Conduct

PyATL is a community user group intended for networking and collaboration in 
the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want 
all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, 
all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees 
during meetups and at all PyATL events, whether officially sponsored by 
PyATL or not.

To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, 
organizers, and volunteers at any PyATL event are required to conform to the 
following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

## Our Standards

PyATL is dedicated to providing a positive conference experience for everyone,
 regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being kind to others
- Behaving professionally
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment of conference participants in any form
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- Sexual language and imagery in any conference venue, including talks
- Insults or put downs
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- Excessive swearing
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Unwelcome physical contact
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds


Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the
 PyATL organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning 
 the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

### Weapons Policy

No weapons are allowed at conference venues, including but not limited to 
explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.

Attendees are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.
